        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One of the things I loved as a kid was pizza rolls. Do you? I cant eat them these days thanks to being gluten-free, but the rest of my family loves them.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Package Totino's Frozen Pizza Rolls</li>
            <li>Olive Oil Cooking Spray</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Spray the basket of the air fryer with olive oil cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Place an even layer of frozen pizza rolls in the basket.</li>
            <li>Add another coat of olive oil cooking spray on top of the pizza rolls.</li>
            <li>Air Fry at 390*F for 8 minutes, I suggest checking on them at 6 minutes since all air fryers heat differently.</li>
            <li>Once done, carefully remove and serve.</li>
        </ol>
